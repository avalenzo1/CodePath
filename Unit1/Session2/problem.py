    # it works!
    #Instead of [[0] * cols] * rows, use [[0] * rows for _ in range(cols)] to ensure each row is a separate list in memory.
    #Never thought such simple things could be problematic! I need to fix my basics!
    # thank you! 
    # frr would u guys be down to connect on linkedin?- yesss!
    # good job guys!!!! www.linkedin.com/in/damontan-6150192b2 - Sent!  lol

    # also I figured out why the window was moving, it was because I was following your cursor i think ðŸ˜­- LOL
